# Linux Server Configuration
A baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine prepared to host web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.



### Setup:
  - IP address and SSH port: 45.76.69.91 -p 2200
  - URL: 45.76.69.91
  - The software installed for this project include: Python3, Flask, Postgres, Nginx, and Gunicorn.
